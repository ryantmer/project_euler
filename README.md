=============

Solutions for Project Euler (https://projecteuler.net/about) questions in Python. Please note the following:

1) These solutions are not optimal. I am certain that most, if not all, have better implementations.

2) If you want to enjoy Project Euler, don't just copy this code. The entire point of PE is to be a challenge; there isn't much challenge to it if you just copy all the solutions, now, is there?

3) These solutions may explode your computer. I am not responsible for repairing it if that happens.
